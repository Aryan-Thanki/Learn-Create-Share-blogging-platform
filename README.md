# Learn Create Share Application

This is a simple guide to help you set up and run the Learn Create Share application. The application is divided into two parts: the server and the front-end (learn create share). You will need to install the necessary dependencies in both folders.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- Java (for running the server)

## Installation

1. **Server Folder:**

   First, navigate to the server folder:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

   Inside the server folder, install the required Node.js dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Learn Create Share (Front-end) Folder:**

   Next, navigate to the learn create share folder:

   ```bash
   cd learn-create-share
   ```

   Inside the learn create share folder, install the required Node.js dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Starting the Application

Now that you have installed the dependencies in both folders, you can start the application. Follow these steps:

1. **Start the Server:**

   In the server folder, run the Java server command to start the backend server on port 3000:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   Replace `server.js` with the actual filename of your server application if it's different.

2. **Start the Front-end:**

   In the learn create share folder, start the front-end application using npm on port 3001:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the front-end application and open it in your default web browser.

That's it! Your Learn Create Share application is now up and running. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project documentation or seek assistance from the project maintainers.
